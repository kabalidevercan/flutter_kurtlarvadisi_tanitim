    "He is the baron of the Wolves Council and is at the top of the mafia. He is the greatest baron of the Greater Middle East . Chosen by the Supreme Chosen, he was appointed Baron in 1983, who could see 10 moves ahead. His predecessor was excommunicated because of Iran . He is a very intelligent and aristocratic character.He was an intelligence officer trained by Doğu Eşrefoğlu in his youth . He served in various positions on behalf of the Turkish Resistance Organization in Cyprus with his partner Aslan Akbey for the state. The most important of these duties is to arm the Turkish Resistance Organization. He distributed weapons on the island in his role as an orange merchant.Mehmet Karahanlı's only weakness is his son, Efe Yakup Karahanlı, who was kidnapped when he was a child . His only failure in life is not being able to find his son. He changed sides due to his weakness for power and betrayed the state during his second mission by Doğu Bey, after the Cyprus Operation , to collapse the secret forces. Karakhanid, who took the side of the mysterious forces, successfully passed various stages and became the Great Baron of the Great Middle East . He established a great empire for his son Efe.Mehmet Karahanlı takes Tombalacı Mehmet Çolak , whom he raised by marrying Esther Hirch , to his council. The impressions of the council members about the new member are also positive. At first, international relations, political issues and balances were discussed in the council. Everyone on the council had at least 20 years of friendship with everyone. However, later on, other things started to be talked about: Şevko 's embassy shared the course of Süleyman Çakır with the council and decided on the situation of these two.The bingo maker made decisions according to his mind, scanned Çakır's casino and had many people killed. Thereupon, Baron Mehmet Karahanlı suspended Tombalacı Mehmet from the Council. By order of the Baron, Kılıç put Bingoci on a boat to leave the country, but when he learned that Bingoci was doing business with the Russians , he ordered Kılıç to inform Çakır of the location of Bingoci's boat. Thus, Çakır caught Bingocı and killed him by beating him with a baseball bat in his casino, which he had scanned.Karahanlı, who has information about everyone around him, can not reach concrete information, although he does research about Polat Alemdar , who only appeared next to Süleyman Çakır as Duran Şatıroğlu's nephew . For this reason, he tries to solve Çakır's partner, Polat, by allowing Süleyman Çakır to be promoted to the Istanbul embassy. After Polat could not solve the mysterious power behind him and Çakır started a war on drugs after he became Istanbul ambassador, the Baron gave the order to kill Çakır, Saw Necmi , who did not like him very much because he was Laz Ziya 's son-in-law from Çakır. . Halit from Cerrahpasa in Saw He sets a trap for Çakır with him and has him killed. In order to avenge the death of his dear friend Çakır, Polat Alemdar kills the members of the ambassadors desk appointed by the council, especially Halit, overnight.When Polat Alemdar's actions go against his own orders and the actions of those in the council, Laz Ziya says that he got engaged to his daughter to prevent this, and the Baron gives up breaking Polat's pen. The decisions made by the Baron in the future take place against the wishes of Laz Ziya and Hüsrev Ağa, and Laz Ziya and Hüsrev Ağa become allies against the Baron.Due to his failure in drug addiction, the Baron broke the pen of Saw Necmi, one of his closest men, in front of Hüsrev Ağa and Laz Ziya. In fact, the Baron will show Saw as an outcast from the council and bring him into the enemy of the council, the Russians, and in this way, he will destroy Alexander Ivanov, the head of the Russian council. On the baron's orders, Saw assembles a team to invite Ivanov to the boat and have him killed. However, Polat Alemdar raided the boat with his men, killed the people there, injured Saw in the shoulder and threw him into the sea, and handed him over to Aslan Akbey.Aslan Akbey, after learning that there will be an assassination against him, comes before Karahanlı and tells him that he will hand over the treasure he has in return for having him withdraw the assassination order given to him. Kılıç, who was in the meeting, thinks simply and tells the Baron that he thinks the treasure that Aslan Akbey is talking about is Saw Necmi. Thereupon, the Baron calls Polat to inquire about Saw, which he has not heard from for a long time. Just as he was about to break his pen, Polat sneezes three times in a row because his opium exploded. This is unique to the Karakhanid family. Seeing this, Karahanlı gives up breaking the pen and asks Polat to work for him.After Saw, Baron Karahanlı brought 2 new members to the council: These are Tuncay Kantarcı and Nedim Malik . Kılıç kills Hüsrev Ağa because Hüsrev Ağa rebelled and insulted the Baron and made an alliance with the Russians . Instead of Hüsrev Ağa, Halil İbrahim Kapar , nicknamed Halo , who was abducted from prison by Polat Alemdar, is appointed as the head of the council's drug business .He was killed in the Temple in Sultanahmet on 3 March 2005 , with a sword stabbing him , on the grounds that he could not pass the 1 March bill to support America in the Iraq War and did not believe in the Supremely Elected. The death of Karahanlı is very similar to the murder of Üzeyir Garih. Üzeyir Garih was also stabbed to death, and his convicted murderer said years later that he did not commit the murder, just like the person convicted of Karahanlı's murder, he only knew how the murder was committed. His death opened a new page in the world.Mehmet Karahanlı combines the unsettled parts in his head just before he was killed and concludes that Polat's son Efe Yakup Karahanlı, who was kidnapped years ago, is himself.",

At one point, Karahanlı asked Kılıç who knows me better than Kılıç? he asks. Sword smiling Mom. he replies. Then the Karakhanid smiles and I fear your mother for Allah's sake. says. Based on this dialogue, it is possible that Karahanlı was given to Kılıç's family for adoption and that this close friendship ( Am I not your brother Mehmet?) can be thought of as starting like this. However, nothing concrete has been said about this in the series.He ensures the safety of the baron, his family and the council. He stands out with his impulsive personality. His characteristic feature is the knife in his hand and the scar on his face. Later, it was understood that this pocket knife was the key to the cryptex and that the scar was made by the intelligence officer named Aslan Akbey, who kidnapped Polat Alemdar as a child. Kılıç asked Nergis Karahanlı and Nizamettin Güvenç whether Polat was Efe, Nergis Karahanlı was not sure whether he was Polat's son or not. Although he hid the fact that he was Mehmet Karahanlı's son, after Polat rescued Safiye from Nizamettin, he became Safiye's brother, therefore Karahanlı. He realized that he was the son of Nizamettin and asked Nizamettin why he had lied to him. Nizamettin ‘You asked me what you wanted to hear, and I told you what you wanted to hear.’ he replied. Mehmet Karahanlı asked Polat to kill Russian İbrahim, Kılıç informed Polat about the Russians and introduced Andrei the Fox, who would appear before Ahıskalı after his death. While in the car with Karahanlı, Yakup Efe asks what is the name of the child Kılıç in the family where Karahanlı was adopted. Karahanlı ‘They named you: Ali.’ says. After Karahanlı's death, he supported the barony of Polat Alemdar. After Safiye Karahanlı was abducted, Tilki suspected Andrei and chased after him, but he fell into Tilki's trap, the police came to the scene, Kılıç' captured his men, but Kılıç escaped. When the sword crypt, which remained in the detention center for a long time, dissolves, he goes to a mountain house and informs Nizamettin. When Nizamettin came there, he shared with Nizamettin that the key to the cryptex was the pocketknife in his hand, and Nizamettin, who learned this fact, killed him by stabbing him with the pocketknife he took from Kılıç to look at the pocketknife.",

His favorite person in the council is Hüsrev Ağa. As the name suggests, he is Laz and a deep Black Seaman. Since he loves the Oy Asiye folk song, he always listens to this song on the show. He has a great animosity with Saw Necmi. The reason for this hostility is that Saw Necmi and Laz Ziya's daughter Meral are in love with each other. Although he tried to kill his daughter Meral, he was emotional and could not kill her.He met Polat Alemdar and loved him like his son-in-law. Arms smuggler Ziya Yılmaz handed over all the crimes he committed when the council lost power and the file containing all the illegal organizations and individuals he worked with, to Doğu Eşrefoğlu because he trusted the state.
